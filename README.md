 // Created a student directory that randomizes students from class using JavaScript. Also displays the last 5 previously generated students.
 //  Styled using divs and css to look like little chalkboards.


// Jesus Salgado Peer Review - Good job! I don't see any issues especially with responsiveness. I like the font used and the chalk board style you went with on this project. Good job on using grid style as well.
